ODT Research
=============================

This site provides documentation, tutorials, publications, research groups, and available codes to aid researchers in using ODT and related models in turbulence research. ODT is the One-Dimensional Turbulence model, and is closely related to its predecessor, the Linear Eddy Model (LEM), as well as the Heirarchical Parcel Swapping (HiPS) model. These models were developed by Alan Kerstein and have undergone continuous development by a number of research groups.
